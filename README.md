# LiaScript

[LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io) is an extension to Markdown to support
the creation of free and open online courses, interactive books and thus, Open
Educational Resources (OER). Courses are simple textfiles, that can be hosted
and created freely by everyone similar to Open-Source project. This projects
contains the just-in-time compiler that runs directly within your browser.

__Website:__ https://LiaScript.github.io

__Extension:__

* Multimedia
* Quizzes
* Text2Speech
* Animations
* Surveys
* Interactive Tables
* ASCII-art
* Online Programming
* Integration of JavaScript
* Mixing HTML with Markdown
* Extentendability due to Macros
* Internal event system
* ...

Furthermore, this project is a
[Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)
, which means, if you open your LiaScript document at the project site at
https://LiaScript.github.io/course/ , the document gets stored on your Browser
linke in your personal library. The Website can be installed localy and all
states are also stored within your system locally. Thus, you have total access
to your courses even if you are offline. And sharing a cours is simply, sharing
the link to the README.md file.

## Related Projects

__Editor:__ There are currently two plugins available for the GitHub-Editor
[Atom](https://atom.io), that should help to ease the writing process of
LiaScript courses.

* [liascript-preview](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-preview): Is a tiny
  previewer that, if it was toggled, updates the view on your course each time
  you save your document.

  GitHub: https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview

* [liascript-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-snippets): If you
  start typing "lia" in your document you switch on a fuzzy search, that
  contains a lot of LiaScript help, examples, and snippets.

__CodiMD -> LiaMD:__ At the
[#SemesterHack](https://hochschulforumdigitalisierung.de/de/online-hackathon)
we updated the free and open online editor for Markdown (CodiMD) to work with
LiaScript. This can now be used to setup and host your own LiaScript online
editor, and it runs also in docker.

* Project-Sources:
  https://github.com/liascript/codimd

* Result-presentation of the hackathon:
  https://semesterhack.incom.org/project/187

__LiaScript-Exporter:__ Currently a command-line tool to export
LiaScript-courses to other formats. At the moment SCORM1.2 is supported that
allows to upload a course packed as zip, into nearly every commonly used
Learning Management System (LMS). A list of supported LMS is contained within
the project description. It has been tested with [moodle](https://moodle.org)
and [OPAL](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal).

__Localization:__ The project internationlization files are contained at

https://github.com/liaScript/lia-localization/locale

If you want to contribute, add a new translation file ...


## Examples

__Templates:__ Since courses can make use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ETC, and
encapsulate functionality within Macros, these Macros can be imported by other
courses. A set of importable documents is hosted at
[GitHub](https://github.com). Every document is a self-contained course
describing the usage of Macro and their implementation.

GitHub: https://github.com/LiaTemplates

__Library:__ At the moment there is a collection of some open tutorials and
complete ports of some Wikibooks (about C Programming, Lua, etc.) that are now
interactive.

GitHub: https://github.com/LiaBooks

## Contribute

Start writing online courses, translate your PowerPoint presentations, Word
documents, LMS courses, etc. into LiaScript Markdown and host them on
[GitHub](https://github.com), but [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) is also
okay. Make your content and notes accessable and searchable on GitHub, so that
it is not lost over time.

If you know some nice JS libraries or services, create a template course, that
can be imported into other courses, to make them even fancier. You can host them
in your own GitHub repository.

LiaScript has a set of connectors to store and retrive data from different
"Backends". At the moment there are three versions, a basic connector, a pwa
connector that makes use of indexeddb to store data, and a SCORM1.2 connector.
It would be great to support a wider range of systems and LMS formats (e.g.
SCORM2004, AICC, xAPI, cMi5, IMS Cartridge).

It existis an an [editor](https://github.com/liaScript/LiaScript/tree/editor)
branch, that is currently used to connect to Atom via the
[liascript-preview](https://github.com/andre-dietrich/liascript-preview) Plugin.
It would be great, to support also other editors in the future.

Add some more localization files to: https://github.com/liaScript/lia-localization

I could not compile the project so far, that it runs on Internet explorer and
other older Browsers, that are still in use. Is there is an expert on Babel and
Parcel out there, who could help?
